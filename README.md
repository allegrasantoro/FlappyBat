"# FlappyBat" 

Flappy bat is an endless “runner” game in the style of the popular 2013 mobile game Flappy Bird. This game shows a radioactive bat trying to avoid stalactites and stalagmites while flying through a cave. The game is still under development, but future versions will include home and pause menus, and custom skins and light colours.
